## Directory structure

This repo uses go modules, `src` is the module directory and it contains all the packages.
Packages are distributed based on their data structure.
For example

`src/linkedlist` contains packages `sll`, `dll` etc

`src/tree` contains packages `btree`, `avltree` etc

<br>
Examples are located in `examples` directory, they are also distributed in the same way as packages.
For example

`examples/linkedlist` directory contains all examples related to linked lists
